# ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Real-Time Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

This project builds a real-time stock market prediction system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models combined with technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and EMA. It pulls **live stock data via yFinance**, preprocesses the time-series data, and predicts the next closing price with high accuracy.
